TROLL QUEST PLAYERGUIDE

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
This game requires JRE 1.7 in order to play.
It is known to run on Windows and Linux.
OSX does not have a java 7 release yet, so this game will not be playable.

INSTALLING
Extract the TrollQuest.zip archive into a folder of your choosing.  It should extract into TrollQuest.jar, TrollQuestStandAloneServer.jar, various documents, 
and a folder called data.

HOW TO RUN
The program is run through com.client.Main (if you have source).  Or from the command line with java -jar pathtotrollquestjar.  Or by simply double clicking
the jar in the extracted archive.

SETTING UP THE GAME
When you run the program, an option panel will appear, which will allow you to configure the game.  If you would like to connect to an external server, click the 
"Create Client" option, enter the IP address of the server, the port number of the server, and click ok. If you would like to host the server on your machine,
click the "Create Server" option, and enter the port you would like the server to be connected on (Please note, that the TrollQuest server uses the port you 
enter, and the next sequential port, so f you enter port 5000, TrollQuest will use 5000 and 5001), and click ok.  Another panel will appear.  Enter your user
name, and click ok.  If you have a profile saved, you will be given access to all previously saved characters, including their stats, items, quest status, and location.
Otherwise, a new profile will be created for you.  This guide will proceed assuming that you are creating a new character.  On the Player creation screen, you may enter
your character's name, its gender, and the class of player you want.  Available Gender's are It, Female, and Male.  Available Class's are Fighter, Thief, and Mage.
You may select your gender by clicking on the appropriate icon, and your class (or saved character) by clicking the up and down arrows.  After you have chosen your 
gender, and class, click the "CREATE!" button.  Your character will spawn on the gamemap.  When you close the game, your profile and all it's characters will be
compressed into a .prof file in data/playerdata/username.   You may reuse this profile and it's characters by entering the same username.

USER INTERFACE
Before you begin playing, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the ui, and controls.  In the top left corner, you'll find your health (green) and magic 
bar (blue).  Your health bar will decrease as you take damage, and your magic bar will decrease as you use magic (Fighters and Thieves do not have magic).  In the 
top right corner, you will see spell books with various names.  These represent your current spells, your active spellbook sticks out slightly, and it's name is
highlighted.  You may select different spells with the number (0-9) keys.  In the bottom left corner, you will find (from the left) the icons for the chatbox, 
the inventory, and the questlog respectively. Click the chat icon now.  The chatbox contains messages from the server, other players, and NPC's (quest information).
If you wish to send a message, type into the chatbox, and click enter.  Your message will go to all other players in the game.  It will be tagged with the time of
delivery, and the name of your character (NOT your username).  Click the chat icon again to close the chatbox.  Click the bag icon to open your inventory.  Here
you can see the Swag items that you have in your inventory.  You may move items around by clicking on them, and clicking on their new, empty location.  You can equip
weapons and armor by clicking on them and then clicking the "Equip" button.  You may drop items by clicking on them and then clicking the "Drop" button.  In the bottom
right corner of the Inventory panel, you can see your available Moolah.  Click the red x at the top right of the inventory panel, or the bag icon again to close the 
Inventory panel.  Click the icon with the book.  Your quest log will open.  This tells you what quest you are on, what steps you have performed, what steps you have
to perform to complete the quest, and the step you must complete next.  Please note that you MUST complete steps in order.  Steps that are completed out of order do
not count towards completing your quest, click the questlog icon to close the panel.  The main game panel displays the map, and all characters on it, as well as your character.
Move your mouse around and notice the yellow arrows that lead from your character, to your mouse location.  These arrows represent the fastest movement path from
you, to the tile at your mouse location.  Move the mouse around and notice how the path changes.  Different tiles have different costs.  For example, it takes a much 
longer time to move through water, then it does to move through desert or plains.  When you left click on a location, your character will begin moving there.  Your path
may be interrupted by clicking again (you will then stop at your next tile, and you will be able to select a new location).  Your path may also be interrupted by 
trying to move into a tile that is already occupied at which point you will stop and be allowed to select a new location.  Notice some of the features on the map.
You will notice some Spiders to the southeast, and some blue shirted men nearby.  The Spiders are Monsters, and will attack you if you get too close.  You may attack
them as well.  The blue shirted men are NPCs.  They exist to provide quests, and some NPCs can buy and sell Swag.

GAMEPLAY
You begin the game with some Moolah, and some basic weapons and armor.  You also start with the Main Quest.  The goal of this quest is to assist Professor Castellanos
in slaying Professor Lane, so that he might become the supreme master of CS351 and thwart students graduation plans.  The first thing you must do, is talk to Harold.
He's the blue shirted man near the edge of the map in your spawn vicinity.  If you walk into an adjacent tile, he will tell you how to proceed with your quest
in the chatbox.
You will only see this message once, so don't forget it!  Harold will tell you to talk to Gerald (the other blue shirted guy nearby) after killing a Bear to
prove your worth.  Head north until you find a Bear.  Stop before you get to close so it doesn't attack you.  In general, Monsters will attack you if you get too close.
Monsters also appear in groups, so it's wise to draw one out from the main group before engaging it.  When the monster is adjacent to you, attack it by holding the "x"
key, and clicking on the monster.  Attacking happens fairly quickly, so you can click as often as you'd like to attack.  You'll probably take damage in the fight, but
don't worry.  Every ten seconds, every Creature in the game recovers some health and magic points.  After you've killed a bear, go to Gerald, and he will tell you
what the next part of your quest is.  He will tell you to go to the Northlands to help Helga.  Move onto the Northern Portal Tile (swirly spiral tile) 
surrounded by purple/black wasteland tiles.  Press the 0 key on your keyboard to activate your Open Spell, hold c and click the tile.  You will be transported to a new 
map where you can continue your quest. Note that the monsters surrounding the portal are rather strong.  You should probably train a bit before leaving the starting
map.  When you kill Monsters, you gain experience.  Once you get enough experience, you will increase in level, gaining additional stats, and possibly other spells, in
addition to Swag and Moolah.  Each map also has it's own Merchant.  You may purchase Swag from them, and sell Swag that you've collected to them.  If you should be
killed, you will respawn at your current maps designated respawn area.  Respawn time for players is approximately two seconds.  Respawn time for Monsters is one minute.

NOTE: Players may attack other Players at will.
