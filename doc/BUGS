BUGS (ROLLOUT)

Panel for interacting with a Merchant does not work.
Reset Time does not actually affect anything.
Occasionally, the GUI will freeze.  This is fairly uncommon however


UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES

Spell animations
Buying/Selling from Merchants
Range casting (Spells have range, but the gui only supports casting on adjacent tiles)


TROLLS
Invisible Mountain Tile
Trollchant keeps shouting at you until you are out of range
The Swag names are pretty funny, but there are no tooltips so you can't see them.
