BUGS (ROLLOUT)

Spell book icon just brings up the Inventory.
State does not serialize on Ians laptop? (we don't know why, it works everywhere else).
Cast and move (together) does not completely work.
When logged in as an Admin(username: Pwner), each step is equivalent to one iteration, which happens every millisecond.  So you have to hold down S for 
a long time to see changes.
Spell animations do not function.
An occasional TileException is thrown when you are moving, and then you die and respawn, but a monster is occupying your respawn location.
