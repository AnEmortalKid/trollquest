NPC dialogue text goes off-screen

How To Reproduce:
1. Start a new character
2. Talk to some of the NPC's in the starting area
3. Bring up the chat view
4. Result: Whatever the NPC said is on a single line with extends off the visible screen and thus can not be read.  

It seems the text is being drawn to the screen, rather than put in a text box of some kind.  So it some form of text-wrapping 
will be necessary to insert line breaks after a certain number of characters.  You will probably need to parse the string, measuring the length of 
each word and deciding whether it can fit on the current line, otherwise insert a new line character.
