1. Open TrollQuest
2. Create/load a character
3. Press the S key
4. Click somewhere

Result: Character gets stuck, can no longer move. Occurs with both client and server instances.

Stephen:  Fixed.  MainHandlerInput was waiting for the command to come back from the server, which it doesn't.  Changed the handling of the single step command
so that it no longer waits for it to come back.
