Ian: the quests panel accurately reflects the current status of the player's quest.  Taylor contends that the quest 
     events are being updated properly.  However, the quests panel isn't showing what we'd expect.  After some 
     deliberation, it turns out that we're both right.  The problem is that, somehow, there are multiple copies of 
     the player (at least, they have different references, and different quest pointers).  This is probably a 
     networking thing.


Taylor: Quest Panel is updating properly now. The two different players is normal since one would be on the server and 
        the other on the client. There was no issue here as Ian thought. 
        The fix came from both the attackCommand and MessageCommand, not properly updating the client's view of their
        quests. I changed both the MessageCommand and AttackCommand to poll the listener's and attacker's (respectively to 
        each command) current quest. Since Commands maintain the synchronization between the server and the client, the
        quests had to be updated by their correct commands.
