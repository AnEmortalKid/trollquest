Hi Stephen,

I didn't see where it said to submit bugs, so I'm just emailing you.

I didn't find any game breaking issues, but the one annoying thing I did find is when I hold x and spam in the location of a 
monster I would occasionally move into the space of that monster. In terrain that takes a while to move through, my character would 
most likely die while the monster attacks and I'm stuck moving.

Taylor: Fixed, you will not move onto another square if a monster is there, you
can only attack or cast on the square

The "menu" button on the bottom left (I think that is what that does) goes to the inventory.

Taylor: Fixed, it now displays your current quest

The thing I thought was the experience bar never changed after I killed stuff. (The top right vertical bar under the books)

Stephen:  Fixed.  That bar is not the experience bar, there are now three bars near characters for health, mp, and exp.



Other than that I didn't see and bugs (in terms of blatantly wrong gameplay).

I do have some suggestions for just the overall usability of the game.

1) Make the chat log text wrap. I had to go to full screen just to see what I was supposed to do.

Taylor: ... agreed. But apparently this is impossible to do...

2) Make the game playable with the chat log open. I can see this might be a problem with the keyboard focus. The way I would do it is normal play
the keyboard is focused on the game. If enter is pressed, then it is focused on the chat panel. Press enter again and it goes back. I 
didn't know that I had started the quest until I poked around the UI menu.

Taylor: Feature Frozen

3) This is just me, but I would have it so if you left click on a space with a hostile monster, it would do the melee attack. Right 
click would cast your current spell. This might clean up the issue with moving into the space when you're holding x.

Taylor: Feature Frozen

4) The lack of information going to the user is kind of  my biggest issue. While attacking I don't know if anything is actually working.

Stephen: Fixed mostly, Healthbars for the creature decrease if you land a successful attack or spell.

* You could have a separate combat log, that you can't chat with or anything.  This way you could at least see the numbers of what is going on.

Taylor: Feature frozen.

* The health and magic bars could have a number ratio on them, so if your max health is 100, and you have 50 it would display as 50/100. 
Or a percentage.

Taylor: Fixed, Players now display percentages 

* Some indicator of the enemies hp. I don't think this would require numbers but it would be nice.

Stephen: Fixed, Monsters now display healthbars.


* Information on what the spells actually do. I assume good drugs is healing and zot is damage, but I don't know. With the other issues 
above I didn't even know if casting was working, or what it was doing.

Stephen:  Fixed, Creatures now display their hp, mp, and xp.
Taylor: spell information si covered in the player's log


* A character information panel. Some way of knowing the stats on your player.

Taylor: fixed, hit ctrl-s

* Since there is no journal of quests info, you could make the chat log be ableto scroll up and down, so you can at least re-read information.

Taylor: fixed, quest log implemented.
