1. Open TQ and server
2. Make a new Character/Select an already made one
3. Level up

Result: There is now an extra set of the first two spells
Expected Result: Either new spells or no spells should be gained on level

Taylor: Fixed.
[11:54:43 PM] Taylor Berger: i wasnt checking to see if you had the spell in your inventory before trying to add the spell.
