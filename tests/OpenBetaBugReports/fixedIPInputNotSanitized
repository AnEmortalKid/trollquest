1. Open TrollQuest
2. Change to Client
3. Enter more than 3 numbers for IP address (Max value should be 255)
4. Hold shift and type numbers for the port (!@#$%^&*)
5. Click Connect
6. Click OK

Result: Exception occurs, invalid IP and ports are accepted, invalid characters are accepted for port and IP.
Expected Result: Only numbers should be accepted for IP/port, and the game should catch invalid IP/Port addresses before continuing to Username screen.

Ian: Fixed.  IP/Port sanitizes input.
