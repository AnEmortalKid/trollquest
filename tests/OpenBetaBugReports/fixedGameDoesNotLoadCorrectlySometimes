The game seems unable to load after a time.

How To Reproduce:
1. Double-click TrollQuest.jar
2. Start a server with the default settings
3. Enter user name
4. After an extremely long time (more than 60 seconds), a blank window pops up.  After about 30 seconds, the window closes itself 
and the game is no longer running, according to Windows Task Manager.
This is the second time it has happened, and it only seems to happen when I use the Esc key followed by the RAGE QUIT option to 
exit the game.  When I simply close the window, I don't have this problem.  It is also frustratingly inconsistent.  The first time 
it happened, I deleted the entire folder and re-extracted the .rar file.  I used the RAGE QUIT option several times, and it seemed to 
work fine.  The next day it happened again.  Changing the port number seems to help.

Stephen:  This should be fixed.  We believe it was caused by compressed profiles, and errors during state serialization.
