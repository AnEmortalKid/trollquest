Bugs found by Ian: 12/13

Ian: Dead monsters sometimes follow you around.  They don't appear to be able to hurt me.
Taylor: Currently unresolved. as for the other one, it has something to do with the cast command.
        If you kill a monster with a spell there is a chance it doesnt die properly. I've checked and 
        rechecked the differences between the spell commands vs the attackCommand and I cannot pinpoint
        the bug. I will continue looking it over after i fix a few other bugs.
Stephen: Fixed.  The problem was that the cast commands were doing different amounts of damage on the client and server.  
Taylor: Really fixed. The problem was the above, but what we thought would fix it did not. I moved
        damage calculation to the CastCommand instead of each individual spell and that
        seemed to maintain synchronization between the server and client.    


Ian: When attempting to cast Open on something not a portal:
Exception in thread "Timer-1" java.lang.ClassCastException: com.game.environment.tiles.terrain.TileForest cannot be cast to com.game.environment.tiles.terrain.TilePortal

	at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Unknown Source)
	at java.util.TimerThread.run(Unknown Source)
Taylor: Open is a result of the way we refactored the casting commands. I will go back and change that now.

 Taylor: I received this bug as well. This was after I ported to another map. A monster 
 was moving towards me at the time Ported, then the games graphics starting moving rather
 rapidly and after I moved about 10 squares I got this exception.
