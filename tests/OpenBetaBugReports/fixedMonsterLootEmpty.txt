BUG: 
 1. Open TrollQuest
 2. Kill a monster
 3. pickup their loot
 
 Result: Monster's loot is not being dropped properly. Either their loot is null, or empty since 
         anything dropped there is not being added to the player's inventory.

Taylor: Fixed, the issue was in the game initializer. Although I was creating
        new loot containers for every monster, I was not giving them the loot
        leading to the empty loot containers being dropped.
