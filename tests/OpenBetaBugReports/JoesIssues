Yo yo yo!


-Start game and click X. Game does not exit but asks for username and launches.

Stephen:  Fixed, game now exits if you click the X.


- Text in box does not wrap properly.

Stephen:  Feature Freeze, this will not be fixed.


- User guide is missing "it" gender choice.

Stephen: It has it now.


- As you level the spells do not work properly. I have several "Good Drugs" spells.

Stephen: You can never have too many good drugs . . . KIDDING.  This has been fixed.


- I can't tell if equipment is equipped or just in my inventory.

Stephen: Stats panel now displays what you have equipped.



- Attack animation is glitchy. I can't tell if I have to keep clicking to attack

Stephen: Playerguide now explains that you must keep clicking.  



- Client will leave java process running if it can't connect in which case it must be forcibly stopped

Stephen: Fixed.  If you cannot connect, an error dialog will appear and then the program will terminate.


- Can not connect to server from client through any non-localhost connection.

Stephen: Could not reproduce.


- Can't move with message box open
- It would be nice to know if my attacking is doing anything.

Stephen:  Agree, however the Feature Freeze is upon us.


- Glitchy graphics when the JFrame is moved or resized
