run TrollQuestStandAloneServer.jar by double clicking, when asked for a port number, click 'cancel' and it 
crashes with an error Port Error "java.lang.NumberFormatException: null" and does not allow the user to cancel out gracefully.

Stephen: Fixed.  If the cancel button is clicked, the program will terminate without error.
