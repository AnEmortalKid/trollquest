Game Froze

This occurred during combat with some spiders.  I started the game with an existing character, spoke to 
the NPCs, and killed two spiders.  I engaged a third spider, and during the fight one of the dead spiders 
re-spawned and attacked me.  The game froze (I could no longer move my character away from the spiders), and 
after a few seconds the graphics went away, leaving behind a blank window (screen shot attached).
