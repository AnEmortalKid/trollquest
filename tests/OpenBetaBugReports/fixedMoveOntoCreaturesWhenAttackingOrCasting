1. Start TQ
2. Connect/start a character
3. Go to some monsters
4. Place cursor over the monster, but don't attack

Result: The box on the grid disappears while the monster is animating, clicking at the incorrect time causes the player to attempt to walk into that square

Stephen: The box disappearing is intended.  But moving onto the Creature when attacking or casting is not.

Ian: Fixed.  Subtle bug someone else introduced into my code.
