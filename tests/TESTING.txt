TESTING STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY TROLLQUEST

Integration Testing
Integration Testing was accomplished primarily through play testing, and the open beta.  During the Beta period, we gave users a runnable jar, instructions,
and asked them to play the game, and complete the main quest.  They were also instructed to submit any bugs they found by email.  These reports are located
in JWorld/tests/OpenBetaBugReports.  We released three builds of TrollQuest during the beta, but were unable to release more due to the constraints of time.


Unit Testing
Unit tests for packages are located:
/JWorld/src/com/server/test

/JWorld/src/com/game/environment/test
/JWorld/src/com/game/items/test
/JWorld/src/com/game/quest/test
/JWorld/src/com/ai/test


Manual Testing
Manual tests for network interaction, and the GUI are located:
/JWorld/src/com/server/test
/JWorld/src/com/client/TestGui.txt

Other Testing
This is just a main method that checks to make sure that a client can connect to a server.
