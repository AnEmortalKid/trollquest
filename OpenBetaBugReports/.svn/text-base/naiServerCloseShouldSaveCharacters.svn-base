1. Open the standalone server
2. Connect with a client
3. Create new character, go die and lose all items, then gain some xp if possible
4. Shutdown server

Result: New character information is lost.
Expected Result: Server should save all active character information both when it closes, and when the client disconnects

Stephen:  Not An Issue.  The users profile IS saved when the player disconnects, or when the server shuts down.  Please check, data/playerdata/ for your profile.
Note that the player is not returned to his original position, but instead returns to the general respawn area.
