Bug Report for initial playthrough of ~10mins



-pressing up moves to a lower spell in the spell list for the wizard, when up should move up in the spell list.

Taylor: Fixed, swapped the VK_UP for VK_DOWN and vice-versa


-none of the spells have descriptions or costs, so the player is left guessing

Stephen:  The PLAYERGUIDE will cover this.



-spells are granted at level 2 that can not be cast due to lack of mana

Stephen:  TROLL



-casting 'fly' at level 3 wizard disables movement for the character (character just stands there and cant move anymore and mana doesnt 
refill, but selecting spells and idle animation still work)

Taylor: Have not been able to reproduce... Still trying to figure out why this happened

-level 2 warrior attacking a level 1 spider cant hit for about 6-10seconds, then walks away, and dies instantly (huge lag?)

Stephen:  You died before but were able to move around, so it SEEMED like you were still alive.  This has been fixed I believe.




-no floating damage numbers, or any kind of notification that you are 'hitting' or even trying to hit the monste
---are you supposed to x+click once, or spam x+click as fast as you can?, the manual or game doesnt explain either (swing timer kinda thing)

Stephen:  Healthbars decrease when you do damage, PLAYERGUIDE has been updated accordingly.




-Guide says that you start the game with some money, and basic equipment, but you dont.

Stephen:  You do.
Taylor: updated player guide does not include this information as it was incorrect.



-'quest log' button opens up the 'inventory', as such there is no way to open the inventory.

Stephen:  Fixed.  quest log now opens the quest log. 



-neither wizard nor warrior when moving next to Harold recieve any sort of quest message

Stephen: I could not reproduce this.  I believe it was fixed before I could test it.
