Upon trying to connect to TrollQuest via IP "76.113.61.45" port 1337, game never starts up, however process stays running in background.


Stephen:  Could Not Reproduce. It takes some time to start the game, Joe and I experienced times of up to 30 seconds. But we did connect successfully.  It is also 
possible that Joe shutdown the server.  Please try again with the latest build, send me an email if you still experience problems.

Taylor: The port number is wrong. I believe Joe's port number is 5000 unless he changed it.
