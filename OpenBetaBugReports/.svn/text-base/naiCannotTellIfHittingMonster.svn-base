Number of Players: 1

Combat system needs some kind of indication when damage is taken or dealt. 
 Currently the only indication of player damage taken is the health bar depleting.  
 There is no way to know if an attack against a monster was successful.

Suggestion: A piece of text (preferably red) could appear above the targeted monster denoting the damage dealt, 
or the word "miss" if the attack missed.  As a further feature, successive hit/miss messages could scroll up 
(up to a certain amount, maybe five or so) before disappearing.

Stephen: Unfortunately, the Feature Freeze is upon us.  This will not be implemented.
