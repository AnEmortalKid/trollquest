1. Open TQ client/server
2. Connect to a server
3. Attempt to name yourself after a monster, e.g. Spider1 or Bear4

Result: ClassCastException com.game.characters.content.monsters.* cannot be cast to com.game.characters.Player
                      at com.client.Main.getSelf(Main:58)
And the main game window freezes

If you want more of the trace, I can get it for you... My command prompt isn't letting me copy the text.


Stephen: Fixed. The get self method in the UI did not check to make sure that an entered name wasn't already in the game. 
Now, if you enter a name of a player that already exists, or the name of a non Player, the ui will bring up the player create screen again.
