1. Start TQ
2. Load a character
3. Die while holding x or c, and click away from the square you are in, and an adjacent monster square

Result: Character starts walking around with no hitpoints
Expected Result: Character is dead and should not be walking
Note: Respawn occurs normally


Stephen: Fixed. . . I think.
The problem was that the gui was still updating the move path, even if the player was dead. So I added a check. 
If the player is dead, the path is not updated. This *should* fix the problem.
