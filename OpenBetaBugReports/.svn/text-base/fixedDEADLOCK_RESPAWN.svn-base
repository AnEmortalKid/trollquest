DEADLOCK ISSUE

1. Open TrollQuest
2. Create a mage
3. Kill yourself with the Zot command
4. respawn on the default spawn location
5. without moving, kill yourself again
6. you should now never respawn.

Result: You dont respawn creating a deadlock issue. I believe this is caused
 by the tile not removing the player, OR since the tile already has a player on 
 it, you cannot be respawned. This issue will be fixed with the implementation
 of friendly fire (or at least your spells wont hurt you).
 
 Taylor: Fixed due to your spells not harming you. A player does need to test
 the higher spells such as flamethrower/armageddon, though I believe I fixed it
