INTEGRATION TEST SCRIPT FOR TROLLQUEST
Fall 2011-CS351-Stephen Patel, Taylor Berger, Martin Tice, Ian Mallett

This script is to be distributed with initial releases of TrollQuest.  The user should execute this script, and log any problems, or suggestions for enhancements.
After executing this script, the user should play the game.  Complete the Quest, kill monsters, explore, etc, all while logging any problems.  If possible test with
multiple users.  This log should be returned to spatel11@unm.edu, along with the following information:
Name, email, and maximum number of users playing simultaneously.  Please be detailed when describing problems.  It doesn't help us fix a problem, if all we know is that
"it doesn't work."  Ideally, we would like the following information when you log a bug:

What was happening when the bug occurred.
Steps to reproduce the bug.
Observations about the bug.  Perhaps it only occurs on a certain map or with a certain character, or maybe it happens inconsistently.

We understand that it is not always possible to provide a great deal of detail, especially with inconsistent bugs, but please provide as much as you can.

The PLAYERGUIDE will walk you through the first few steps in the Main quest, so follow along, and then continue with the quest.
