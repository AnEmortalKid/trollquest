User test script to test GUI functionality.  Feel free to add on to make more complete, or to make changes to reflect code modifications.

Begin by connecting the client.  Presumably, this will be on a local network.  You will need to open Main.java and change the flags at the top so as to make a server and not locally test.  You will also need to find the expected user's name.  Currently the way the player is set up is very rudimentary.  this is a necessary consequence.

User control flow is modeled progammatically.  Infinite recursion is possible in some cases.  The user is asked to not be stupid in this regard, and to do several depths, to at least some degree.  Testing the whole parameter space is rather tricky.

1. Run Main.java.  Three dialogs should come up in succession.  Enter in the expected user name, and then {branch goto 2,3}

2. Choose male.  {branch goto 4,5,6}

3. Choose female.  {branch goto 4,5,6}

4. Choose first class.  {goto 7}

5. Choose second class.  {goto 7}

6. Choose third class.  {goto 7}

7. A window should open.  The appropriate character animation should appear in the center of the screen, surrounded by an array of tiles in an isometric persepctive.  There should be two bars, one with a heart next to it.  Also, there should be a taskbar with three yellow-ish icons.  {goto 8}

8. Move the cursor around.  A highlighted tile should appear on the ground.  A yellow sequence of arrows leading toward this square of choice should appear.  Pressing x and c will change the color of this path to red xor cyan, respectively.  Click.  The character should move along the arrows to the target square.  Ensure that the character's movement looks natural.  Some pausing between individual moves is permissible.  Be sure that the character's animation plays.  Walk to all corners of the map.  {branch goto 9,10,11}

9. Press CTRL-m.  A message panel should open below.  Type, being sure to press all keys on the keyboard, including special keys.  Press ENTER.  The message should be appended to the chat log.  Do this several times until the messages leave the message pane.  There should be three yellow messages and an orange message that you are typing into.  Press CTRL-m again. {goto 8}

10. Press CTRL-i.  This should open the inventory panel.  Select spaces by clicking on them.  Hovering over a space should make it turn temporarily yellow.  There should be 0 gold.  Click on the X to close the inventory panel.  Open the panel again, but this time close it by pressing CTRL-m again. {goto 8}

11. Press ESCAPE.  This should open a quit panel dialog, which should descend from the top of the panel.  It should have two buttons labeled "RAGE QUIT" and "Cancel".  {branch goto 12,13}

12. Press "RAGE QUIT".  The window should close.  There should be no exceptions recorded anywhere at any time, although some debug output is permissible.

13. Press "Cancel".  The quit window should retract back into the top of the panel.  {goto 8}
